2. open project folder

3. go to dev branch using ('git checkout develop')

4. install packages using 'npm install'

5. Rename .env.example to .env and set environments

start the application:

1. In development mode:

`npm run start:dev`

2. In production mode:

`npm run start:prod`

3. In cluster mode:

dev `npm run start:multi:dev`
prod `npm run start:multi:prod`

3. Run tests:

## API

1. Implemented endpoint `api/users`:
   - **GET** `api/users` is used to get all persons
     - Server should answer with `status code` **200** and all users records
   - **GET** `api/users/{userId}`
     - Server should answer with `status code` **200** and record with `id === userId` if it exists
     - Server should answer with `status code` **400** and corresponding message if `userId` is invalid (not `uuid`)
     - Server should answer with `status code` **404** and corresponding message if record with `id === userId` doesn't exist
   - **POST** `api/users` is used to create record about new user and store it in database
     - Server should answer with `status code` **201** and newly created record
     - Server should answer with `status code` **400** and corresponding message if request `body` does not contain **required** fields
   - **PUT** `api/users/{userId}` is used to update existing user
     - Server should answer with` status code` **200** and updated record
     - Server should answer with` status code` **400** and corresponding message if `userId` is invalid (not `uuid`)
     - Server should answer with` status code` **404** and corresponding message if record with `id === userId` doesn't exist
   - **DELETE** `api/users/{userId}` is used to delete existing user from database
     - Server should answer with `status code` **204** if the record is found and deleted
     - Server should answer with `status code` **400** and corresponding message if `userId` is invalid (not `uuid`)
     - Server should answer with `status code` **404** and corresponding message if record with `id === userId` doesn't exist
2. Users are stored as `objects` that have following properties:
   - `id` — unique identifier (`string`, `uuid`) generated on server side
   - `username` — user's name (`string`, **required**)
   - `age` — user's age (`number`, **required**)
   - `hobbies` — user's hobbies (`array` of `strings` or empty `array`, **required**)
3. Requests to non-existing endpoints (e.g. `some-non/existing/resource`) should be handled (server should answer with `status code` **404** and corresponding human-friendly message)
4. Errors on the server side that occur during the processing of a request should be handled and processed correctly (server should answer with `status code` **500** and corresponding human-friendly message)
